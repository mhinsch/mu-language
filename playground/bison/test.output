state 0

    NUM 	shift, and go to state 1

    S   	go to state 6
    E   	go to state 2
    T   	go to state 3



state 1

    T  ->  NUM .   (rule 4)

    $default	reduce using rule 4 (T)



state 2

    S  ->  E .   (rule 1)
    E  ->  E . '+' T   (rule 2)

    '+' 	shift, and go to state 4

    $default	reduce using rule 1 (S)



state 3

    E  ->  T .   (rule 3)

    $default	reduce using rule 3 (E)



state 4

    E  ->  E '+' . T   (rule 2)

    NUM 	shift, and go to state 1

    T   	go to state 5



state 5

    E  ->  E '+' T .   (rule 2)

    $default	reduce using rule 2 (E)



state 6

    $   	go to state 7



state 7

    $   	go to state 8



state 8
